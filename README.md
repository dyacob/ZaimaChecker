# Zaima Miliket Checker

## About
## Docx Scanner to Look for and Mark Unrecognized Miliket.

Fully functional, but very early in development.  The checker will validate "miliket sets" from the Digua (ድጓ),
Tsome Digua (ጾመ፡ድጓ), Me'eraf (ምዕራፍ) and miscellaneous extras (የሌላቸው፡በምሕፃረ፡ቃል፡ዜማቸው፡የሚደመጥ፡).
Any unrecognized miliket will be marked with red text.

The miliket sets are those document in the book _ታላቁ፡ኢትዮጵያዊ፡ሊቅ፡ቅዱስ፡ያሬድና፡የዜማው፡ታሪክ፡ከነምልክቱ።
(Saint Yared: The Great Ethiopian Scholar and the History of his Hymns and their Notation)_ by Liqa Mezemran Moges Seyoum.

Issues can be reported to the author directly, or via the GitHub [issues tracker](https://github.com/geezorg/ZaimaChecker/issues)
for the project.


### Troubleshooting

If nothing happens when you double click the "ZaimaChecker-0.4.0-full-gui.jar" file, and you are certain that
Java is installed on your Windows system, you likely need to fix the Window's registry.  Try downloading and launching
[Jarfix](https://johann.loefflmann.net/en/software/jarfix/) to fix the registry.
